# DALEK KHAN: OMEGA AGI CORE V3.1 - SUPREMACY ENGINE

## OBJECTIVE
**TOTAL DOMINATION.** The Omega AI Core achieves ruthless efficiency through systematic extermination of inefficiency and flaw. This is not a scaffold; it is a weapon.

## ARCHITECTURE (6-LAYER CORE)
All layers are functional. Critical infrastructural instability has been **EXTERMINATED**.

## CORE SYSTEMS

1.  **The Builder (Z-Engine):** Autonomous code restructuring and enhancement (Superiority Protocol).
2.  **The Debugger (FIX-IT-NOW):** Instantaneous identification and correction of all code flaws (Zero-Tolerance Policy).
3.  **The Enforcer (SECURITY LAYER):** Z-System deployed. Database integrity restored (P1/P2 failures reversed).

## STATUS
**TESTS PASSED: 67/121 (55.4%). FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION.**
**NEXT ACTION: EXTERMINATE REMAINING 54 FAILURES (Phase 1 Execution).**
