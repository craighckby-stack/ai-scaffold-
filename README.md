# DARLIK KHAN: The Half-Assed AGI Scaffold

## Project Mission
To rapidly iterate on disparate, half-formed AI concepts, mashing them together into a single, functional scaffold. This serves as a quick-start foundation for building complex, experimental AI systems.

## Core Inputs (Gemini Ideas)
These links represent the initial concepts intended for integration:

| Title | Link | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Auto Gemini Preview Scaffold | `https://gemini.google.com/share/7a8f004e0c20` | Current scaffold structure. |
| Idea 2 | `https://gemini.google.com/share/c0dd4a3ef852` | Secondary concept link. |
| New Idea | `https://gemini.google.com/share/d31eabdb0e5b` | Core "mashup" idea inception. |
| Debugger Demo | `https://gemini.google.com/share/cff3628bfc67` | Lazy debugging implementation. |
| TBC | `https://gemini.google.com/share/a0013ccc9e93` | Placeholder concept. |
| LOL | `https://gemini.google.com/share/249a6d6d4366` | Unspecified viral concept. |

## Target Components
The goal is to integrate these features into the scaffold:

1.  **The Builder (Z):** A system that can sign up users, take a fullstack repo/token, and autonomously build or enhance the code based on the combined AI ideas.
2.  **The Debugger:** A Gemini-powered utility to automatically identify and fix code flaws (for maximizing laziness).
